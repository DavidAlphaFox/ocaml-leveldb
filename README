ocaml-leveldb: OCaml bindings for Google's LevelDB
===================================================
Copyright (c) 2011 Mauricio Fernandez <mfp@acm.org>

These bindings expose nearly the full LevelDB C++ API, including:
* iterators
* snapshots
* batch updates
* support for custom comparators

Blocking functions release the OCaml runtime system, allowing to:
* run them in parallel with other OCaml code
* perform multiple LevelDB operations in parallel

Note that iterator, snapshot and writebatch values require external
synchronization if two threads share such values.

Requirements
------------
* OCaml >= 3.12.0
* GCC with C++ frontend (g++)
* omake to build
* oUnit for the unit tests

Building
--------
Just 

   $ omake

should do. It will build both LevelDB and the OCaml bindings.
